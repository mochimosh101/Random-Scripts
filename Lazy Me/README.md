# MochiBot: Mochi's Little Assistant 

📝 Note:

- This is still working in progress since I just started learning programming and github platform.
- This is aim for people like me who always make new servers and need to quickly get started and set it up.
- Please message me if you want something to be added to this project, I will be more than happy to do it.
# **Usage**

### Manual Usage

📝 Note: I will soon make it where you can run MochiBot internally without
needing to type the this whole command down below!

_On Linux_: 

Open a terminal and run the following:
